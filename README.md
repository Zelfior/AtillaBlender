This is the draft of a blender plug-in to import and export TotalWar Attila .cs2.parsed file.

It is tested on the 4.2 version of blender, but should work beyont 3.0 (maybe 2.8).

To generate the extension zip, from windows run make_zip.ps1. On other OS, zip the blender_module.py file along with the src folder.
